This repo contains the code for a full-stack web application connecting senior citizens to venues where they can study art (ideally for free).

## Goals/ ideals for this project:

* **Accessibility through simplicity and clarity. It is important this app loads quickly (think, Progressive Enhancement and Mobile First); It should be zoomable (responsive font-sizing) and visually uncomplicated (careful color, contrast, and font selections). It should drive people toward experiences in the physical world where they can connect with other people.**

* **Lifelong learners, will register securely for access to arts courses, created by teachers and admin. Once registered or logged in, learners will be greeted with a menu of arts courses for which they may register.**

* **Teachers and admin may create user accounts as well, but with special privileges which will allow them to create, edit and view courses and their students. Teachers will be able to take attendance in the app.**

* **With a multi-language translation API, text-to-speech API and speech-to-text APIs, all users will be able to select their preferred language and have the option to have the site information read aloud to them.**
