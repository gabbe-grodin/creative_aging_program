   <h1>A Creative Aging Project</h1>
</div>

This repo contains the code for a full-stack web application connecting senior citizens to venues where they can study art.

Goals/ ideals for this project:

Accessibility through simplicity. It is important this app loads quickly (Progressive Enhancement);
Zoomable and readable (careful color and contrast selections);
Multi-language translation API connection;
Mobile first;
With older learners in mind, text-to-speech API and speech-to-text APIs; 
Fostering fairness in a system where every learner is valued equally and given equal opportunities (as many members as possible have access to the resource).
