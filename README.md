   <h1>A Creative Aging Project</h1>
</div>

This repo contains the code for a full-stack web application connecting senior citizens to venues where they can study art (ideally for free).

Goals/ ideals for this project:

Accessibility through simplicity. It is important this app loads quickly (think, Progressive Enhancement and Mobile First);
Zoomable and readable (careful color and contrast selections);
Multi-language translation API, text-to-speech API and speech-to-text APIs.
